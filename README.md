This project is about Multiple Linear Regression exercise.


The purpose of this assignment is to hone matplotlib skills, and expose ourselves in an elementary multiple linear regression problem.


The provided data has been generated from a simple linear model, but some random noise has been added. Goal is to perform a multivariate ordinary least squares linear regression to determine the Best Linear Unbiased Estimators (BLUE) for the model. There will be some irreducible error due to the noise that was injected into the data, therefore we will never be able to exactly recover the "true model parameters". However, the optimal model parameters computed via the linear regression analysis are sufficiently accurate to infer the true model parameters for ourselves!
